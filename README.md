## Problem Statement
The objective is to develop a web application that allows teachers to efficiently manage and analyze student performance by uploading Excel sheets containing student details and marks. The system should provide statistical insights such as highest and lowest marks, the number of students who have a KT, and other relevant metrics. Additionally, the application should enable the teacher to send individualized result notifications to each student via email. Furthermore, the system should support teachers with multiple courses, enabling them to simultaneously process and analyze data from two separate Excel sheets.
